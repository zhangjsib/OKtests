 MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls.  The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by use of hierarchical clustering.   An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperform commonly used nonparametric methods such as pairwise Anderson-Darling test and permutated Anderson-Darling test in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity.
